Kaxo Technologies is a Canadian technology company focused on the intersection of human expertise and artificial intelligence.

We develop agent-based systems that work alongside humans, not to replace them, but to amplify their capabilities and free them to focus on what matters most.

Our approach combines deep technical expertise with a clear understanding of real-world business challenges.
